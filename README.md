# Graphix

Graphix is a highly adaptable graphic editor development framework designed for quick construction and scalability. It offers a universal model and skeleton views for graphic editor scenarios, allowing for the easy creation of any type of graphic editor (flowchart editor, 3D editor, etc.) through the extension of plugins and components.

- ðŸ”Œ Simple and user-friendly API design.
